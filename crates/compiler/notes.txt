ControlFlowGraph:
class Foo111 {
  a=(console.log(1),1);

Update graph_map on merge to point to node of representative
Merge derived pointers when merging. e.g. A.prop and B.prop are the same after merging A&B

set MIMALLOC_SHOW_STATS=1

set RUSTFLAGS=-Zprint-type-sizes & cargo build --release --target-dir ./temp-cache > dump.txt 2>&1

Store names outside of ast. Just store e.g. index into list of names. Allows us to rename without modifying AST.
