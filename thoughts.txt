Identify all properties that are "externally visible"/exported. These properties are ineligible for renaming.
Examples include exported variable, public properties of exported classes, global variables, values passed to
unknown/blackbox places like DOM methods, proxy/reflection, dynamic property accesses (unless the set of keys is known).

e.g. properties of "Foo" are ineligible in the following:
window.foo = Foo;
unknownFn(Foo);
Foo[unknownKey] = 1;

If two entities, A and B, share a property name ("prop1"), which is eligible for renaming on both entities,
and it can be proven that "prop1" is never accessed on a value that could be an A OR a B, then A's "prop1"
and B's "prop1" can be renamed distinctly e.g. to "A$prop1" and "B$prop1".

Simple version: for all static property accesses (e.g. "obj.prop") and declarations (e.g. "obj = {prop:1}"),
determine if their object is invalidated (public/exported/dynamic). If none of the objects that have a given
property are invalidated, then all references to the property can be conflated/renamed.


Track 'objects':
    - Created by object literals
    - Need to track:
        * Can flow into variables through assignment/declaration e.g. `a = {}` or `const b = {}`
          Then need to track variable usage, including all aliasing
        * Literal can be used directly in expressions e.g. `({a: 1}).a` or `callFn({a:1})`
        * In all cases, should refer to same 'object'.
        * Need to record all references to object and its properties.
    - Properties are declared by writes/declarations e.g. 'a' in `const v1 = {a:...}` or `v2.a = ...`
    - The properties of an object are the set of all properties that are written to the object, even
      they occur after a particular read.
    - If the object is accessed dynamically or in an unknown way, we pessimistically assume that it is
      modified in any/every way, and invalidate if for optimisation. e.g. for object in variable 'a':
      `a[someExpression] = ...` or `fnCall(a)` or `window.v = a`
    - When an expression could be a number of different objects they are conflated e.g.
                     obj1                obj2   obj1 âˆª obj2
                     vvvvv               vvvvv       v
      if (...) { a = {...}; } else { a = {...}; }    a;



For each function:
    - Track object invalidations and property reads/writes.
        * If the object in question can be resolved to a locally defined object, these invalidations/reads/writes
          can be directly attributed to the correct 'object'.
        * Else, a stub object is created to record this function's interactions with the object.
          e.g. `a.foo` and `a.foo = ...` are respectively recorded as a read and write to property 'foo' on some
          object referenced by 'a'.
          Similarly, `a().foo` and `a().foo = ...` are recorded as a read/write to property 'foo' on some object
          returned by the function 'a'.
        * The info collected in each function is then iteratively reconciled until a fixed point is reached:
            # Stub objects from variables are matched against, and conflated with, variables from parent functions
              that may have been captured by the inner function.
            # Stub objects from function calls are matched against, and conflated with, objects returned from the
              called function.
          Once a fixed point is reached, we should 
        * Else, a stub object is created to record this function's interactions with the object. e.g. for non-local
          variable 'a': `a.foo` and `a.foo = ...` are respectively recorded as a read and write to property 'foo'
          on some object referenced by 'a'.
          Similarly,


Invalidations can have dependencies e.g. `foo(a)`: 'a' is invalidated by the call only if 'foo' invalidates its first param

Collections are opaque bags of values - we track the types that go in, and the output type is the union of the inputs.
We don't care about the specific values that are in a collection at a point in time, or which specific item is outputted.
insert item and retrieve item e.g.
array: push, index with [i] etc
Map: set, get

Object literals are a special kind of collection where we attempt to know the set of possible keys and info about their
mapped values. This is not possible if the object is accessed dynamically using computed properties, in which case we
can't track its properties or their values, but we can track the output type (union of inputs).

If a collection is invalidated (e.g. assigned to unknown variable, passed to unknown function), then we can't conclude
anything about it, and any value entering it is invalidated.

TODO:
catch and throw
destructuring

Compute maybe reaching defs.
For each ref, its type is the union/conflation of types of maybe reaching defs.
Type of def is union/conflation of types in its RHS


A prop access should only force a conflation merge of the conflation constituents that contain the property. More similar to AmbiguateProperties.
The only properties that must share the same name are those that are:
(1) in the intersection of a conflation's constituent's properties; and
(2) accessed as a property of the conflation
Need to consider sub/super types as well, for classes and object/function prototypes.

For now, accessing the prototype of an entity should invalidate it, and any entity assigned to a prototype should also be invalidated.

if function is invalidated, invalidate its output

two versions of function analysis:
1. "owned" analysis of the code within the function. Used to do renaming of the function's code.
2. "other" analysis used to compute side effects and return value at call site

for the code within a function, we need to track the union/join of its possible values.
e.g.
function foo(a) {
  a.prop;
}

foo({prop: 1});
foo({prop: 2});

the property ref in the function should be recorded on the union of the two object literals.
after each call, join function's saved lattices with the final lattices after the call

at call time, gather external dependencies of function and pass them to it (params and non-local vars)


for each function create placeholder types for each param and the return type.
run type inference on te function to discover the relationships between inputs and outputs
e.g. that a function returns its first parameter. Then each call can substitute the types of its arguments
for the function's param placeholders to find the return type for those particular args.

Then for the function as a whole, the type of each external dependency within its body for the purpose of renaming
is the union the types the external dependency had for each call.

simplify the call graph by:
  for each function:
      for each non-function return type:
        if function depends on return type and function and type ae not already directly connected:
          add edge from function to return type
  remove all function-function edges

function analysis should yield the return type in terms of the params or constant/static/local objects.
this template must be in terms of calls, property accesses, unions, and references, to params.
this template can then hydrated by the caller, passing in arguments to be substituted into the template

visit non recursive paths(no cycles). then propagate that return value through the cyclic paths until fixed point

backwards flow, from leafs inwards

convert return type into a finite state machine of transforms/accesses on the params.
this can then be executed against the arguments at call time.
e.g.
function foo(arg) {
  if (cond1) {
    return foo(arg).prop1;
  } else if (cond2) {
    return foo(arg).prop2;
  } else {
    return arg.prop3;
  }
}
foo could return the value of a any property chain in arg consisting of "prop3" followed by 0 or more "prop1" or "prop2".
e.g. arg.prop3.prop1.prop1 or arg.prop3 or arg.prop2.prop1.prop2

start at each leaf (should be a param placeholder), try to match. need to find all matchings, so don't
stop after first match, keep going until no matched possible. at a fork (>1 out edges), fork execution and match all branches


for writes to params,union the prop assignments for the param at each return site..

at a call, return "call" type and record the cfg node under the call. Then, when the 'call' type is resolved,
the call site cfg nodes can be added to the dataflow analysis work queue, and a re-analysis computed.
this should propagate the new side effects and return type forwards.

maybe have separate analyses for global and each function, so its easier to "call" them


todo: computed props aren't really visited/analysed


allow each out edge to be traversed n times per path, where n is the in-degree of the node

don't add outdated dependants to call queue. When we pop and process a call, remove outdated dependednts

create DAG by compressing SCCs. Then use (presumable existing) algorithms to process DAG in parallel.
One 'lower' nodes have been processed, they never need to be touched again, and their resources can be freed/reused

if a function invalidates all of its arguments, we don't need to

Sub and super type relation graph. Built-ins are represented as invalid objects (so their props aren't changed).
Instances of these built-ins (such as number literals) are their own objects that are a subtype of the built-in.
